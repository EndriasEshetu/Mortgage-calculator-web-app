- Vite 8
- ESLint

## Getting Started

## Mortgage Formula Used

The app uses the standard fixed-rate mortgage payment formula:

M = P x [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Where:

- M = monthly payment
- P = loan amount
- r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
- n = total number of monthly payments (years x 12)

If the interest rate is 0, monthly payment is calculated as:

monthly payment = loan amount / total payments

## Validation Rules

- Purchase price must be greater than 0
- Down payment must be 0 or greater
- Down payment cannot exceed purchase price
- Repayment time must be greater than 0
- Interest rate must be 0 or greater
